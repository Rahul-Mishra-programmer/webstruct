              <p><b>&quot;Yes, I find your mag absolutely uplifting and it totally 
                verifies the message of Princess Diana's Message of Peace. Diana 
                is a warrior for peace and I am like her personal secretary now. 
                It is as though Heaven stepped in, through the goodness of Princess 
                Diana. She is very much watching over our country and our world 
                and is influencing the top diplomats she knew in life with her 
                wisdom on the war on terror. She is waging peace for the nations 
                as an angel looking down upon us all. Her diplomatic suggestions 
                are a true and viable answer for the diplomats, to save us from 
                this terrible war on the planet.&quot;</b> (<a href="http://www.dianaspeakstotheworld.com"

                <b>&quot;John Jr.'s interview with Lady Diana prompted me to finalize 
                in my own mind a lot of details about work 'The Boss' gave me 
                to do with students - I realized I can do it on videotape, and 
                publish a book of my own Opinion Columns to be sold along with 
                the presentation, ones that will benefit teens. Part of my 'job' 
                is to convince them to sign a contract with themselves regarding 
                celibacy, no drug or substance abuse, and to do their very best 
                in all aspects of life. To clearly state their goals, and to read 
                their contract once every few months to remind themselves, when 
                they're tempted. A space for a date they gave up, and a few lines 
                for the reason why - and then another line for the date they resume, 
                and what their extension is, to give themselves the full five 
                years (I might do three year ones too). So, while Diana is in 
                the Other Realms wanting to help the children, God has already 
                given me the direction of one way to help. He first told me almost 
                a year ago now, but I thought I had to go out and do all this 
                in person - it was only after I read JFK Jr.'s interview with 
                Diana that these plans solidified more...&quot;</b><br>

                I really <br>
                don't know how to answer your question. I don't know if I hear 
                you reading my words. One problem is a matter of delay from the 
                time I said them to Father Murray and the time you read the excerpts. 
                Secondly, sometimes my words are edited. It isn't that I don't 
                recognize my own words but I don't go back over my visits and 
                conversations. On the other hand, I do feel and sense kind thoughts 
                and good wishes. I am not strong enough nor sensitive enough to 
                identify the source or the person sending me the kind thoughts. 
                I have a name for the warm feelings. I call them glow plugs or 
                the warm and fuzzies. They make me feel good and they last a long

              <P><b><FONT SIZE=+1>Dear Marcia,</FONT></b></P>
              <P><b><FONT SIZE=+1>You see, flattery will get you anywhere. You 
                and your question roused me out of my stupor. Although I need 
                the cooperation of Robert, I am responding to your question about 
                Joan d'Arc or Joan of the Rainbow.</FONT></b></P>
              <P><b><FONT SIZE=+1>I haven't come across Joan and I assume she 
                has risen to heights greater than mine. I am not surprised by 
                this because I, in spite of my herculean efforts, remain at a 
                basic level. It could very well be that they are not ready for 
                old Mark Twain and are preparing a very large feast and ceremony 
                for my elevation. I'm sure these preparations take time and I, 
                if nothing else, am a patient person, or soul, whatever the case 
                may be. </FONT></b></P>
              <P><b><FONT SIZE=+1>During my, now behind me, youth, I was surrounded 
                and greatly influence by women. In my old age I was surrounded 
                by women. You might say that I was always surrounded by influential 
                women. During my travels and stay in England, I was told by an 
                Anglican Prelate that God was an Englishman and had protected 
                their Sceptered Isle since Roman days. I of course presented an 
                argument that God was an American and the battle was on. He was 
                sneaky about the whole fracas and anointed me with Holy water 
                and that, besides nearly drowning me, dampened me down considerably. 
                Here is the point I am getting to; This Church Prelate admitted 
                that he admired Joan of Arc. As perverse as I am, I decided to 
                prove him wrong and that started my research into the life of 
                that wonderful and courageous woman. </FONT></b></P>

              article by John F. Kennedy, Jr. in the April 2003 issue of <I><A HREF="zine.html">The 
              Stars Still Shine Magazine</A></I>, a reader asked the contributors 
              of the magazine who are in the afterlife why they feel the need 
              to continue to do physical work such as cooking, cleaning, running 
              or exercising. David responded and here is his answer:</FONT></P>
            <BLOCKQUOTE> 
              <P><FONT SIZE=+1><b>&quot;I specifically asked to answer your e-mail. 
                Where you may look forward to having what you perceive as a life 
                of leisure, once you cross over things take on a different shade.</b></FONT></P>
              <P><b><FONT SIZE=+1>There is so much involved in the doing of anything 
                and so little involved in having things done for you. We tried 
                having everything done for us and found something lacking. We 
                found lots of things lacking. Let me count the ways. </FONT></b></P>
              <P><b><FONT SIZE=+1>Let me take your question of why we keep on 
                doing physical work. Ask a runner why she or he wants to run. 
                The answer is not because I want to get from A to B. I could travel 
                by bus, car or another means that would transport my body without 
                having to do much. The runners say they run because of the 'high' 
                it gives them when they reach a certain point in their run. They 
                become addicted to running because it makes them feel good. We 
                do physical exercise for various reasons, but mostly because it 
                makes us feel good both mentally and physically. When we serve 
                others, we feel useful, needed and are giving of ourselves. That 
                my dear, is worth getting off our collective butts and moving. 
                </FONT></b></P>
              <P><b><FONT SIZE=+1>Enforced idleness becomes a form of punishment. 
                It truly does. We also do some chores because we take pleasure 
                in the routine. Beside that, we still like to complain and just 
                love to have an excuse to 'bitch' about the routine things we 
                have to do. </FONT></b></P>
              <P><b><FONT SIZE=+1>Some of us don't do all the things we say we 
                do. With present company excluded, some of us fake the chores 
                and try to impress others with the hours of hard work we put in. 
                Some of us have been known to work twenty-five hours in a twenty-four-hour 
                day. </FONT></b></P>
              <P><b><FONT SIZE=+1>We also like to continue doing the things we 
                did while alive on Earth. Humans like to have familiar things 
                around them and like to remember what it was like in the good 
                old days on Earth. We do acquire selective memories of our times 
                on Earth. As more time passes, the more the immediate past life 
                becomes quite rosy. So the few hours we spent at the local health 
                club, the exercise machines that were used as clothes racks, the 
                one marathon we stumbled through in great pain while on Earth 
                become changed over time. The few hours at the health club somehow 
                become a year of great camaraderie with fellow health nuts. The 
                exercise machine becomes a wonder machine that we used religiously 
                every day to tone up our muscles. The marathon becomes our moment 
                in the sun in our memory.</FONT></b></P>

                heart.&nbsp; I first discovered channeled info from Edgar Cayce 
                (I named my little dog after him, Cayce) and Shirley Maclaine.&nbsp; 
                I found your Web site while surfing the&nbsp;Web last year.&nbsp; 
                I immediately purchased your book!&nbsp;&nbsp;It has changed my 
                life.&nbsp; I often recall the words Michael has said and use 
                his experiences to try and incorporate them into my own life.&nbsp; 
                I have read many books about&nbsp;crossing over, but none have 
                shed the light on experiences such as these.&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I 
                ask myself, why would crossing over&nbsp;end our experiences to 
                grow?&nbsp; It just makes sense that we MUST learn life's lessons 
                to love without judgement and respect all beings...If I could 
                reach through this notebook monitor, I would give you (James) 
                and your father a great big hug.&nbsp; Thank you for being here, 
                and listening to that there is to&nbsp;hear.&nbsp; I am so excited 
                about these readings!&nbsp; Thank you, Thank you, Thank you! Peace, 
                Love and Light to you. BTW, JFK was an amazing interview!!&nbsp; 
                How very lucky you are to be a part of this&nbsp;channeling/drawing 
                experience!&nbsp; I wish I were so lucky!&quot;</B> <BR>

              <P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;</FONT>Thank you for making such a great 
                magazine. I think it's amazing to hear the thoughts and feelings 
                of people as they create a new life in the afterlife. I'm still 
                pretty new to opening my eyes beyond the physical and I think 
                your magazine is a great way of building a bridge between the 
                two worlds. </B></P>
              <P><B>I have read Bruce Moen's books about his journeys into the 
                afterlife and I think it's interesting to make comparisons and 
                find common ground between your experiences. I hope you will keep 
                expanding and I will surely keep reading your magazine.<FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1>

      <p class="moviereviewtext">The album as a cohesive statement of an artist’s intent has  become less prevalent in the age of ever-evolving digital accessibility. Somehow it takes balls to release the grand plan for the now in a large chunk  known as the album with people mostly preferring to control the pace of  releases through previewing material on some obscure fan site or secreting  drips and drabs of mp3s over a couple of years. The belief in the album as a  bold piece of work has all but given up the ghost. But along comes Manhattan beats machine  Gang Gang Dance’s new record <em>Eye Contact</em> to renew this belief.<br />
      <br />
      Keyboardist Brian Degraw’s dance outfit have launched an  ambient, trippy and break beat opus that invades the mind and the soul in equal  measures.<br />
      <br />
      The opener, 'Glass Jar' is a grand, sprawling work that  swings effortlessly from a dreamy soothing start to an up-tempo melodious synth  and drums monster. Siren like vocalist Lizzi Bougatsos adds to the euphoria as she  sings in twisted squawk, &quot;I care for you like a mother&quot;. Immediately you are  reminded of a more dance driven incarnation of other 4AD artists like Cocteau Twins and Dead Can Dance. This track sets the epic tone and masterful mixing  of rhythms for the rest of the album.<br />
      <br />
      The multi-ethnic influences come to the fore in second track  interlude '∞' as the Middle Eastern folk chant tangles with an ambient synth. This mellowness is in direct opposition with the drama that takes up the reins  on 'Adult Goth'. This could be Bjork backed up by Orbital soundtracking some Euro Thriller as keys pound out a tension building melody. The scale and  widescreen effect of the composition and wild vocals makes the track one to  anticipate greatly if ever you see the band live. The pace is kept up by the  softer synth chords on 'Chinese High'. The beats bounce with glorious rhythm  and again the artists uses world music patterns, this time of the far eastern variety as the title would suggest. Surprisingly a Chaka Khan like keyboard  solo comes in near the end to add to the layered fun.<br />
      <br />
      'Mindkilla', another high    point of the album, has Bougatsos in M.I.A and Fever  Ray mode as her vocals are at her most piercing and effecting. For a band  renowned for their exciting performances they are really adding some meat to  any perceived superficiality. This is relevant and pulsating upbeat dance music  for all listeners whether old skool or modern.<br />
      <br />
      '∞ ∞', the second interlude piece doesn’t really add much  to the album other than keep the flow consistent and trippy, whereas 'Romance  Layers' cuts through the electro-clash towards something approaching an  Eighties soul love song remixed and layered to become something spacey. It  works for the most part as the drums throb to a keyboard groove and the deep  soulful singing of Bougatsos. 'Sacer' finds the listener back in a serene  flow as the vocalist does her best Liz Frazer impression and the chiming guitar  reaches for the ether amongst the blips and beats. Again it elevates the album  out of the ordinary. As the music is stripped down we can appreciate the  twisted treatment of the vocals as it seamlessly glides into a third  interlude/link '∞ ∞ ∞'.<br />
      <br />
The record ends in typical high drama as the drums follow a  military beat and the singer is indecipherable squealing top form on 'Thru And  Thru'. The keys are also on heavy duty as the song reaches a climax with all  instruments building together. The album fittingly ends with an eastern horn  battling against the spray of cymbals as an automated voice says, &quot;Live  forever&quot;. As a statement on the album’s longevity that might be sometime of an  exaggeration but I feel that this will be something that will be remembered for  a reasonably long time to come.<br />
<br />
Gang Gang Dance have produced a set of songs that are  invested with a sort of epic grandeur more associated with serious concept  albums but they do more than enough to pull this off without losing the  excitement and fun of intelligent dance pop music. This is one for the end of  year polls without a doubt.<br />
